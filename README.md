# essential_c_setting_up_vsc_for_linux

At the moment, I'm studying essential C at KAMK, H2C. Actually, I'm not used VSC to code C, because I mostly use Code::Blocks.
## installation

First of all, you need to install VSC and the C++ extension for VSC.

Then you need to make sure, that gcc is installed. You can do that in terminal by typing the command,

gcc -v

If not, you need to install it,

sudo apt build-essential gdb
